# Changelog

All notable changes to `sprite-gen` are recorded here. Versions track the `version:` field in `SKILL.md`.

## v1.8.1 — Cross-platform hardening

Fixes from an adversarial cross-platform / blast-radius review of the v1.8.0 curator.

- **FLIP animation reliable on Safari/Firefox.** The reorder and settle animations now force a layout reflow between applying the inverted transform and enabling the transition (instead of a bare `requestAnimationFrame`), so cards slide instead of teleporting on non-Chromium engines. `.missing` cards are excluded from the FLIP.
- **Missing frames preserved.** `commitZones` and `seedEntries` keep not-yet-extracted frame slots in `order`, so a reorder during incremental extraction can't silently drop them.
- **Multi-touch guard.** The reorder grip ignores secondary pointers (`ev.isPrimary`), so a second finger can't start a parallel drag on touch devices.

## v1.8.0 — Curator: drag reorder + candidate pool

The standalone curation webview (`serve_curation.py`) gets a full frame-curation pass: reorder the play sequence by hand, scrub the preview, and reconstruct a run from several generated takes by dragging the cuts you like.

- **Drag-to-reorder frames.** Grab the `⠿` grip on a frame card to change the play order. The grabbed card lifts and follows the cursor while the others slide aside (FLIP animation), and it eases into its slot on drop. The new order saves to `curation.json.selected` and is baked left-to-right by `compose_sprite_atlas.py` — no backend change, fully non-destructive.
- **Two-row curation: sequence + candidate pool.** Each state now renders a **sequence** row (the selected play order, on top) and a **candidate pool** row below it (unselected frames — e.g. a second or third generated take of the same row). Drag a cut from the pool up into the sequence to add it, or a sequence cut down to drop it; a card click sends it to the other row. This makes it easy to reconstruct one clean run loop from the best cuts across multiple takes.
- **Preview transport.** The live preview gains play/pause, frame-by-frame stepping (`⏮`/`⏭`, auto-pauses), and a 0.25×–4× speed control, plus a `cursor/total · #frame` readout. Display-only — these never touch `curation.json`, so paused inspection and stepping don't disturb the selection.
- Selection is now a flag with a separate display order, so toggling a frame no longer re-sorts the sequence. i18n (en/ko) throughout.

Curator UI: `scripts/curator/curator.js`, `scripts/curator/curator.css`.
